      <h2>about your pet</h2>
      <p> On her way back from school, Natalie saw a poor dog looking for a shelter. It was raining heavily. The dog was completely drenched. He was shivering. Natalie asked her father to stop the car. She ran towards the dog. She picked him up and kept him in her car. The dog was very weak. Natalie was very kind. She wrapped the dog in a warm cloth.</p>
